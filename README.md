Ever died in a hard boss fight with a friend on Mediumcore, managed to recover your items but died again in the process of organizing your inventory and equiping all of them again? Your problems are over with this! When you die, it takes a snapshop of your inventory and when you recover your items, they'll go to the same place they were before! You can even assign a hotkey for it to help manually equip items you got =)
